# Collatz-Conjecture-And-Scott-Flansburg-Paradigm
Graphical analysis of Collatz Conjecture And Scott Flansburg Paradigm with same convergence nature.

## Collatz conjecture
Algorithm:

1. Create a function collatz that takes an integer n as argument.
2. Create a loop that runs as long as n is greater than 1.
3. In each iteration of the loop, update the value of n.
4. If n is even, set n to n/2 and if n is odd, set it to 3n + 1.
5. Print the value of n in each iteration.

## Scott Flansburg Paradigm
Algorithm:

1.Take the number as input
2.Use a loop to get the sum of all the digits
3.Repeat the process till the number value becomes 0

Both the above Paradigm converge at same rate.
